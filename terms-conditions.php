                  <h2>Return </h2>
                  <p>We do not facilitate returns for fulfilled orders due to the personalized nature of our products. However, for customers seeking adjustments, like editing and proofreading services, along with adherence to specific requirements, we offer a revision process.</p>
                  <p>In ensuring quality standards, such as editing and proofreading services, and adherence to specified requirements, our revision process is available to assist all customers, prioritizing their satisfaction above all else. Should the delivered product fail to meet the initially specified requirements, we conduct a thorough internal review and will proceed to revise or recreate the content at no extra charge.</p>

                  <h2>Revision </h2>
                  <p>Every package is accompanied by its specific revision policy, outlined in the service description. Revisions are offered within a timeframe of 5 to 10 days from the moment the order enters the "Waiting for Customer Approval" status in our Order Management Platform. The actual revision duration is contingent upon the package ordered.</p>
                  <p>Upon the product's presentation for review and its status transition to "Waiting For Customer Approval," customers can request revisions. This can be initiated by directly emailing their designated project manager. Any content changes made by the client after fulfillment but before publishing are owned by the client, as the content is delivered in a Word format.</p>
